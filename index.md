### Data Analytics

[Forecasting Flood Inundation in Calgary, Canada and Denver, CO](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/kristinchang/CPLN675Midterm/blob/main/Chang_Epstein_Midterm.html)
<br><br>
This project utilizes a generalized linear model to predict areas of future flooding in Denver, Colorado trained on past data from the City of Calgary in Canada. The predictions are intended to hypothetically inform Denver City Agencies such as Public Works, Public Health, City Planning, and Emergency Management to better prepare for future flooding disasters. This was the midterm exercise for the Land Use and Environmental Modeling course taught in R at UPenn in Spring 2021.

[Policymaker's Toolkit for a Green New Deal](https://kristinchang.github.io/MUSA550-Final-BazilChang/)
<br><br>
Toolkit for a Green New Deal consists of a Sentiment Analysis of tweets using the hashtag #GreenNewDeal, a Spatial Analysis of Fossil Fuel Infrastructure and Air Pollution, and an analysis of Air Pollution levels in Louisiana from 2001-2014. These analyses are meant to provide digestible summaries of complex datasets for policymakers advocating for environmental justice in regions most impacted by fossil fuel production and climate change. This was the final project for the Geospatial Data Science in Python course at UPenn in Fall 2021.
